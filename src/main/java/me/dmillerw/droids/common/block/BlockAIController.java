 * Every second (20 ticks), the AI controller first iterates through its network, and gets the latest list of required

 * New tasks are assigned to available droids, the rest simply sit until a droid is available to work on them
 *
 * Deleted tasks are marked as such, with the droid implementing whatever cleanup processes are necessary until
 * complete
 *
 * Finally, the AI controller will update the status of any tasks that have changed, and provide that information
 * back to the controllers
